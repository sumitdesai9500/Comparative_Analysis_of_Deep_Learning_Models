# Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models on Lip Reading Datasets

- **Conducted an in-depth comparative analysis** of 7 different deep-learning models:
  - CNN_RNN
  - ResnetMobile_VGG
  - CNN
  - Resnet
  - ResnetMobile
  - VGG
  - VGG_lstm

- **Compared the models** based on various metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Timing
  - Precision

- **Plotted a graphical representation** of the values obtained to gain a better understanding of the performance.

- **Proposed two new models** (CNN_RNN and ResnetMobile_VGG) that were not previously used in similar scenarios.

- **Found that these new models performed well** compared to other deep learning models.
