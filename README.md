# Comparative_Analysis_of_Deep_Learning_Models
Conducted an in-depth comparative analysis of 7 different deep-learning models(CNN_RNN, ResnetMobile_VGG, CNN, Resnet, ResnetMobile, VGG, VGG_lstm) on small-scale lip reading datasets.
Compared the models based on various metrics like accuracy, Recall, F1 Score, Timing, and Precision.
Plotted a graphical representation of the values obtained to get a better understanding of the performance and make better decisions.
During this proposed 2 new models(CNN_RNN, ResnetMobile_VGG) which were not previously used for such scenarios performed well as compared to other deep learning models.
